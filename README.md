📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Census Income Dataset
🔍 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Census Income (Adult) dataset to understand data structure, identify quality issues, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling. The focus is on data understanding, cleaning, and visualization.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

📌 EDA Steps Performed
1. Understanding the Dataset
Loaded the dataset and assigned meaningful column names
Checked dataset shape, columns, and data types
Viewed sample records using head(), tail(), and sample()

2. Data Inspection

Identified numerical and categorical features
Used info() to inspect null values and memory usage
Checked summary statistics using describe()

3. Data Cleaning

Identified missing values represented as "?"
Detected duplicate records
Examined inconsistencies in categorical columns

4. Outlier Detection & Treatment
Detected outliers in numerical columns (e.g., age)
Applied Winsorization to cap extreme values and reduce skewness

📈 Key Outcomes

Gained a clear understanding of dataset structure and quality
Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers
Improved data reliability through cleaning and outlier handling
Generated automated EDA reports for faster insights
